<div class="text-container">
	<p>To learn more about javascript, I started an hobbyproject where I tried to create the solar system with a framework called Three.js. This framework is based on WebGL, and allows you to create 3D environments in websites. I thought this was a very exciting and interesting thing to try out, as it offers so many different possibilities! Hence, I decided to create something based on something I have interest in, astronomy.</p>
